### Privacy

In light of recent events, there is a precedent being set for freedom of speech and personal freedom. So I have decided to use products that respect your privacy and freedom of speech.

- **Write.as**

This is an amazing project focused on privacy and anonymous writing. I will be using Write.as for blogging at [Peter Skaronis](https://peterskaronis.com)

- **Reading.Supply**

I have setup a [Library](https://library.peterskaronis.com) at Reading Supply. This ia project still in Aplha but looks very promising.
